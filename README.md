🥗 Nutrition and Workout Analysis using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing nutrition intake and workout patterns to predict an individual’s Fitness Outcome Score using Machine Learning regression models.

The goal is not only to build predictive models, but also to demonstrate a complete end-to-end ML workflow, including dataset design, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance improvement.

🎯 Project Objective

To build, train, and evaluate machine learning regression models that can accurately predict an individual’s Fitness_Outcome_Score using structured nutrition and workout data.
